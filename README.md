## The project
We created a quiz game about friends.You click on a button to select your answer and as you do that, the counter below will
let you know how many questions you have done and how many you have left. When you've answered all 5 questions you there will
be a summarypage to let you know how do did in the quiz. Depending if you did good or.. not so good, you get different gif in the
summary section.
